Object-Oriented Interview Questions

Give three different examples of inheritance. Write these class definitions and their inheritance relationships out in Ruby.
  A.  
		  class LoudPerson < Person
		  @@class_name = "LoudPerson"
		  def say_name
		    puts "HEY YOU, MY NAME IS #{@name.upcase}!"
		  end

  B.   
			# class F sub-class of GF  
			class F < GF  
			 def initialize  
			  puts 'In F class'  
			 end  
			end 
	C.
	       # class S sub-class of F  
			class S < F  
			 def initialize  
			  puts 'In S class'  
			 end  
			end  
				       		

What is the difference (in your own words) between a local variable, an instance variable, and class variable.

	A local variable is only used short term in its general scope. The instance variable is set within a class and can be used with many other objects in the class. Then a class variable is only used with one particular object. 



What is encapsulation?
	Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into a single component.


What is a private method?

	A private method can be called only in the context of the current object; you cannot invoke another object's private method.


What is the difference between a class and an object? What is the difference between a class and an instance?
	An object is an "instance" of a class.   A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. An instance is a single and unique unit of a class.


What is "duck typing" in Ruby?
	Duck typing is one of the virtues of the Ruby language, it adds a lot of flexibility to the code, and allows us to use objects of different type in places where only specific methods are needed.



Describe "Polymorphism"

Polymorphism is the use of many types of objects from one interface. 



What is a "base class", "sub-class", and "super class"?
	   A class that is derived from another class is called a sub-class (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
